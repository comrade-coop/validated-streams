# Validated Streams

Validated Streams are a consensus primitive that allows nodes to agree on and react to any observable event in the real world, not just user transactions.
This primitive will be utilized as a building block of the [Apocryph.Network](https://apocryph.network/), allowing different instances of [Perper Applications](https://github.com/obecto/perper) to agree on a stream of events and synchronize their state by implementing the Event Sourcing pattern.
